**Building Blocks for a Safe(r) Open Source Software Supply Chain:Reproducible Builds and Software Heritage**

<ins>Abstract</ins>

Securing the software supply chain, in particular when it comes to its
free/open source software (FOSS) components, is all the rage now.
Applied researchers, industry consortia, and practitioners alike are
trying out a variety of approaches looking for the ones that will
stick. In this talk we will review two building blocks for a safe(r)
FOSS supply chain that are seeing significant adoption.

On the one hand Reproducible Builds [\[1\]](https://reproducible-builds.org/) enables
downstream users of FOSS products, whose source code they trust, to establish trust in
binary versions of the same products built by untrusted 3rd parties.
On the other hand Software Heritage [\[2\]](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) has
assembled the largest public archive of software source code a version control system
information, providing traceability at the scale of public source code
with strong integrity guarantees.
