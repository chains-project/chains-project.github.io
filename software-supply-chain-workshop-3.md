Bio: Piergiorgio Ladisa is currently an Application Security Engineer at ING. Before this role, he has been a Security Researcher PhD Student at SAP Security Research and Universit√© de Rennes, where he was a member of the DiverSE INRIA research team. His primary research areas revolve around software supply chain security, open-source security, and malicious code detection. During his doctoral studies, he outlined a comprehensive taxonomy of open-source software supply chain attacks and he is the the main author of the ‚ÄúRisk Explorer for Software Supply Chains‚Äù open source tool.
Before his PhD, he achieved a MEng double diploma in Computer Engineering from Polytech de Nice Sophia Antipolis and Politecnico di Bari in 2018. 

Title: Understanding and Preventing Open-Source Software Supply Chain Attacks

Abstract: In this talk, we explore open-source supply chain attacks, aiming to understand and prevent them. We present a comprehensive, technology-agnostic taxonomy of these attacks and the mapping of existing safeguards that mitigate them. We also detail how third-party dependencies gain execution on downstream systems and suggest automated detection methods for malicious packages within open-source supply chain attacks. First, we present the evaluation of a machine learning-based approach for detecting malicious packages in JavaScript and Python. Then, we present the evaluation of a static approach to identify malicious packages in Java.

Bio: I'm a programmer interested in the cloud-native world, identity management, security and Linux programming in general.
I've been developing software for 15+ years, mainly in the Open Source world and have experience both as a individual contributor to OSS projects and as a maintainer. both on the upstream side and the downstream side of the project. Most of the OSS projects and work teams I've been involved in were fully remote and in my role I've been working fully remotely as a part of a team distributed across several time zones.

## Poster submission

If you indicated "Yes" to present a poster, you are already accepted!
Please email the PDF of the poster to amansha@kth.se with *title* and *abstract* and we will get it printed.
The size of the poster should be *A1*.
After the workshop, we will also host the posters on this website.
